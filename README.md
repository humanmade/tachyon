Tachyon is a faster than light image resizing service that runs on AWS. Super simple to set up, highly available and very performant.


## Setup

Tachyon comes in two parts: the server to serve images and the [plugin to use it](./docs/plugin.md). To use Tachyon, you need to run at least one server, as well as the plugin on all sites you want to use it.

## Installation on AWS Lambda

We require using Tachyon on [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/details/) to offload image processing task in a serverless configuration. This ensures you don't need lots of hardware to handle thousands of image resize requests, and can scale essentially infinitely. One Tachyon stack is required per S3 bucket, so we recommend using a common region bucket for all sites, which then only requires a single Tachyon stack per region.

Tachyon requires the following Lambda Function spec:

- Runtime: Node JS 18
- Function URL activated
- Env vars:
  - S3_BUCKET=my-bucket
  - S3_REGION=my-bucket-region
  - S3_ENDPOINT=http://my-custom-endpoint (optional)
  - S3_FORCE_PATH_STYLE=1 (optional)

Take the `lambda.zip` from the latest release and upload it to your function.

For routing web traffic to the Lambda function, we recommend using [Lambda Function URLs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/urls-configuration.html). These should be configured as:

- Auth type: None
- Invoke mode: `RESPONSE_STREAM`

Alternatively, you can use API Gateway; this should be set to route all GET requests (i.e. `/{proxy+}`) to invoke your Tachyon Lambda function.

We also recommend running an aggressive caching proxy/CDN in front of Tachyon, such as CloudFront. (An expiration time of 1 year is typical for a production configuration.)

## Credits

Created by Human Made for high volume and large-scale sites. We run Tachyon on sites with millions of monthly page views, and thousands of sites.

Written and maintained by [Joe Hoyle](https://github.com/joehoyle).

Tachyon is inspired by Photon by Automattic. As Tachyon is not an all-purpose image resizer, rather it uses a media library in Amazon S3, it has a different use case to [Photon](https://jetpack.com/support/photon/).

Tachyon uses the [Sharp](https://github.com/lovell/sharp) (Used under the license Apache License 2.0) Node.js library for the resizing operations, which in turn uses the great libvips library.
